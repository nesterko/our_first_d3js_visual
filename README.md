Boilerplate code for an interactive visualization with linked displays

This is a test boilerplate visualization for linked displays. Here is how the boilerplate page looks:

The exercise aims to demonstrate basic functionality of the library and how to write concise reusable code with it. It also demonstrates basic display brushing using D3, with two template displays below as boilerplate. To start working on it, pull from the Github repo:

https://github.com/nesterko/our_first_d3js_visual

Then run 'bash server.sh' (requires Python 2.7.x installed on your computer) in the Terminal, go to 

[http://localhost:8888/our-first-d3js-visualization/](http://localhost:8888/our-first-d3js-visualization/)

After that, erase the header from index.html, and go explore and edit jdriver.js (there are more instructions in the file).

Enjoy!

ps. There are several things used here, such as Jade, which are not yet described in-depth.
You don't need to know them to go through the exercise and experiment with the code.
